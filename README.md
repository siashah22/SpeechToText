# DESCRIPTION OF SPEECH TO TEXT TOOL 


A **speech-to-text program** converts spoken language into written text using automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology. Here’s a brief breakdown:

1. **Input:**
   - The program takes audio input, typically in the form of a recorded voice or live speech.
   
2. **Processing:**
   - The audio is processed to extract features such as speech patterns, frequency, and pitch.
   - The audio is then converted into text using either machine learning models or predefined algorithms.

3. **Methods:**
   - **SpeechRecognition Library:** This method uses APIs (like Google’s speech API) to transcribe speech. It's simple and works well for general purposes.
   - **Wav2Vec 2.0 (Deep Learning):** A more advanced method based on deep learning. It uses pre-trained models to recognize speech with greater accuracy, particularly in noisy environments.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the transcribed text, which can then be used for further processing or analysis.

This process is useful in applications like transcription services, voice assistants, and accessibility tools for the hearing impaired.
